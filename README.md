# Python Practice
Practice Python with 100 Exercises

I will add at least 100 little exercises I did to learn Python. Still starting out, so they will begin easy and get harder as I go.

Tasks:
1. Name/Age -- How many years left till 100years old. (NameHundred.py)
2. Odd/Even -- Show if a number between 0-100 is odd or even. (OddorEven.py)
